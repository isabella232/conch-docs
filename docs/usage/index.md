# Usage

Conch is meant to enable datacenter operators and integrators to effecitvely
manage and build datacenters.

We provide a reactive UI written in mithril.js for the web interface, and a
command-line utility written in Go.

Both the web UI and CLI use the same Conch API -- but they may expose different
features. Generally speaking, the web UI is useful for Datacenter Operations and
Integration staff, and the CLI tool is useful for System Administrators or
operating Conch itself.
